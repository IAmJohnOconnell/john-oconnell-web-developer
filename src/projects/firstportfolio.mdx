# First Portfolio

This was my first go at a portfolio. It was frankenstiened together from a bunch of stuff I thought was trendy or cool at the time.

## Project Purpose and Goal

When I first began trying to find work as a web developer, this was the portfolio I used.
I went to Google and searched for "web dev portfolio". After clicking on countless results, I copied from them what I believed were the best parts. Ultimately, It did the trick, but I'm appropriately embarrassed at this now..I mean the bar graph...ugh.

## Web Stack and Explaination

This was styled up with Bootstrap. I believe Bootstrap 3 had just relased when I worked on this, so when it came to responsive design I always reached for Bootstrap.
Thinking back, I'm not certain Grid or Flexbox existed yet. I used PHP for the email script, which was the only time that I've ever used PHP. At least it was fun while it lasted.

JQuery was used to handle the animations and DOM manipulation. JQuery was a very popular library in those days. Despite it being very heavy. This eventually lead to projects like YouDontNeedJQuery.com and it wasnt long until browser upgrades along with imporovements to the CSS spec made it largely obsolete.

## Room For Improvements

Although I'm glad I'm no longer offering services as a "Jedi Master" its kind of a bummer that I never managed to wield a lightsaber professionally.
My trendy polaroid photo is sideways. I'm not sure if this is intentional or not...I hope not. Then there is the bar graph of skill competency. I'm deeply sorry for this, and cringe at the error of my ways. Hindsight being 20/20, I dont think I knew 90% of JavaScript, whatever that means - Which by the way, is listed twice. Go me!
Oh well, we live and we learn. I've learned a ton.

## Problems and Thought Process

At the time my problem was not understanding what I was trying to say. A lot of the design elements make no sense and I'm not sure if they did at that time either. The bar graph is...bad. The twitter feed widget doesnt work anymore, nor does the contact form. I remember not enjoying my short time with PHP. But I needed to put myself out there, and sometimes you just have to get on with things, and make adjustments as you go.

## Lessons Learned

At the time I was proud of scraping this together and It even landed me several interviews and a job!

I've already gone on about the many things I would change, and thankfully my current portoflio and work is a lot better.
But without building this first, I probably would never have grown as a developer.
