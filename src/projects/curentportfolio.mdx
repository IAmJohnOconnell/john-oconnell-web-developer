## Project Purpose and Goal

I needed a place to showcase my work. My current portoflio hadn't received an update in a while so I took this as a challenge to bring my portoflio site up to date, as well as learn something new.

I have had my eye on Gatsby for a while. I was intreguied by GraphQL and how that all worked, so I saw this as a great opportunity.

## Web Stack and Explaination

I used React because I'm really enjoying component based thinking and design. It makes building up pages easy and was perfect in this case becasuse i knew I'd have lots of resuable elements, like cards and buttons; Perfect for components.

## Room For Improvements

Portfolio's are always evolving, I'm sure I'll come up with some things I'd like to change given some time. but I'm pretty happy with this for now.

It was a larger project, and now that Its done I'm wondering if React was necessary. I didnt use much state management, and I'm sure there are other ways to build up components...

## Problems and Thought Process

This was my first time working with a static site generator or with Gatsby and GraphQL. I had some issues determining how I wanted to structure my queries. Turns out I needed both static and page queries to get the job done.

I also had a fair challenge styling my markdown pages. I decided to make template files and imported custom shortcodes and components into them to create a layout for each post and project. It took some time to figure out, but worked out pretty well. Needed an MDXProvider for each....wont forget that!

## Lessons Learned

Enough about Gatsby to rebuild my portfolio with it!

<br />

Working on this leaves me feeling more dialed in to the big picture of a project. I quickly discovered the importance of good folder structure. I learned
the value of planning, and how much more valuable having good documentation is, when that plan inevitibly fails.

<br />

I've always understood the benefits of variables in CSS. Now I can personally attest to their value. With so many components, not having variables would have been an nightmare, If i were to my mind on the styling. Which I certainly will do.
