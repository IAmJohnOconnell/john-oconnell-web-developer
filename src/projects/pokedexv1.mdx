## Project Purpose and Goal

This was built for some pratice working with API's and async functions. I've always been a fan of the franchise so thought this would be fun to work on.

## Web Stack and Explaination

Since I'm only looking to pull data, I didnt think it was necessary to beef up the project with a framework or extra bells and whistles. I opted to stick with the "Big 3". HTML CSS and Javascript, along with Axios to make the http requests easier to work with.

## Room For Improvements

This does its job but is pretty bare bones. It could be freshened up with some interactive UX, and a smaller card design, currently the app takes up a lot of the viewport and could be scaled down.

Also, I've noticed that some of the pokemon descriptions come in a variety of languages, which could be filtered appropriately.

## Problems and Thought Process

My biggest hurdle here was traversing through all of the nested data I wanted to take advantage of. Particlarly, the pokemon descriptions were tricky to get working properly.

# Lessons Learned

Building this gave me a lot of confidence working with API's and asynchronus code. It was a fun way to re-enforce what I knew about error handling and different methods of form validation.

The PokeAPI has a lot of deeply nested data that required some finesse to access and format the way I wanted.
