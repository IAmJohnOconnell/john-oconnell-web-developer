# Viridian Dynamics

I build a website for the fictional company Viridian Dynamics, from the show Better off Ted.
I always found this company and their "commercials" to be hilarious. I built a lot of these when I was learning web development. This was always one of my favorites.

## Project Purpose and Goal

Fundamental skills practice after learning some basic web development concepts. I was able to practice coding up a website using a framework like Bootstrap.

## Web Stack and Explaination

HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Room For Improvements

I used Bootstrap a lot when I was getting started because it made creating responsive sites much easier than it was with native tools. Grid and Flexbox were still up and coming back then, so Bootstarp gave you an escape from margins and floats. Now Bootstrap isn't needed at all to create something like this. If I revisit this, I'll swap out Bootstrap for CSS Grid.

## Problems and Thought Process

Everything was new and overwhelming to me back then. I must have stumbled through the whole thing. Thankfully I've built a few of these at this point, so I was able to find my way even after getting lost several times.

## Lessons Learned

As one of my early projects I'm sure I learned a lot. I probably spent more time debugging CSS than anything as back then CSS and I had a relationship based solely on trial and error. Thankfully, We're a lot closer now.
