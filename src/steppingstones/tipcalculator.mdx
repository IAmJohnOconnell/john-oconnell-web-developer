# Tip Calculator

An early JavaScript project that allows you to split the bill between friends, and include a tip.

## Project Purpose and Goal

I needed JavaScript experience and to be honest, I'm horrible at determining how much to tip and how to split a bill. I always want to tip fairly, but am embarrisngly slow at math and rather error prone.
So this solved a problem. Saved it to my favorites and was able to use it to tip properly whenever I went out to eat.

## Web Stack and Explaination

This is a simple HTML CSS JavaScript project.

## Room For Improvements

For a basic tip calculator, I'm pretty happy with it.

One idea I had for a feature to add would be to record the locations and history of your calculated bills.
That way you can see what you usually spend at a resturant and plan accordingly.

## Lessons Learned

For a simple exercise in JavaScript it was nice to be able to revisit and re-use something a few times a week.
Since I was just getting started, being able to use this project in my daily life gave me the motivation to continue down the web dev path. Because building useful things, is pretty awesome.
