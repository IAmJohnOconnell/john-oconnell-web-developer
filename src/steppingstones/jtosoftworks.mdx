# JTO SoftWorks

This was probably my first attempt at creating a website of my own. I designed it in Photoshop then coded it up as closely as I could.

## Project Purpose and Goal

I wanted to get familiar with designing a website from start to finish. So I did just that. At that time I was most comfortable in photoshop. Having done a lot of projects with it in the past It wasnt too much of a challenge to put together a relatively high fidelity mock up to work from.

Then I opened up my editor and got to work.

## Web Stack and Explaination

I used what I knew at the time, which was next to nothing. I designed this in Photoshop, then used HTML and CSS to code it up.

## Room For Improvements

This never got used for anything more than practice, and It served that purpose well. Even after having built a ton of websites since this one, I still appreciate it as a stepping stone project that helped me move in to a career that I love.

## Problems and Thought Process

I was obsessed with trying to make everything "pixel perfect", and did not set myself up for success in the design to begin with. I had a loose understanding of grid systems and web development in general. After breezing through the design in photoshop, this was more of an uphill hike at the time.

## Lessons Learned

In the process of making this, I learned about lorem ipsum placeholder text and most imporantly how to see a project through to completion.
I've sinced learned to use more industry design tools, such as AdobeXD and SCSS, but as long as you have a solid fundamental understanding, the tools themselves dont matter much.
This also taught me that I really enjoy writing code, and coming up with solutions to problems (Even if I created them), but that I may not have the best eye for design.
